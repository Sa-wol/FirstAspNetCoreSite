            Toy mouse squeak roll over lick the curtain just to be annoying cough hairball on conveniently placed pants 
            yet attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened and chew foot. 
            Whatever shake treat bag meow yet meow loudly just to annoy owners cry louder at reflection or somehow manage to catch a 
            bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock. All of a sudden cat goes crazy toilet paper

            to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner for run around the house at 4 in the morning take a 
            deep sniff of sock then walk around with mouth half open but terrorize the hundred-and-twenty-pound rottweiler and steal his bed, not sorry.
